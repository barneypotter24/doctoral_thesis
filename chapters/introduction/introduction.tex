All living things exist in a constant state of conflict with the biological agents that exploit them in the arena of evolution.
Since the advent of civilization humans have sought an upper-hand in this biological arms race: we harvest the flora and fauna that surround us through agriculture and domestication to our benefit, and we fiercely seek to defeat the plants, animals, and disease-causing pathogens that would do us harm.
While we have largely found means to overcome the challenges of our natural environment to lengthen and improve our lives, the eradication of parasites, bacteria, and viruses remains one of the great challenges facing mankind.
Indeed, as the human population grows and urbanizes we become increasingly vulnerable to new diseases more rapidly than ever before.
Concurrent with the exponential growth and globalization of humans is a demand for increased quality of living; which in turn necessitates the human colonization of natural environments that were previously uninhabited by humans in search of land and resources.
This intrusion into environments puts us into greater contact with animals that host diseases that our species has never before encountered, leading to an ever-increasing risk of emerging infectious diseases (\gls{eid}s) jumping from their natural reservoir into human beings, and spreading at unprecedented speeds through their new susceptible hosts.
Perhaps the greatest of these threats is that posed by viruses.\\

Viruses are the root cause of some of the \gls{eid}s that have caused the most human suffering and death over the last hundred years.
They have been responsible for outbreaks that have affected local regions (e.g. Ebola virus in central and western Africa \& MERS-CoV in the Arabian peninsula) to epidemics that can seasonally threaten large portions of the globe (e.g. Dengue virus, RSV, and West Nile Virus) to pandemics of global scale that threaten all people (e.g. seasonal influenza viruses, \gls{hiv}, and \gls{sarscov2}).
In fact, viruses have been responsible for all major pandemics since the year 1900: six major influenza pandemics (ranging from the 1918 Spanish flu to the 2009 H1N1pdm09 ``swine flu''), the \gls{hiv}/AIDS pandemic beginning in 1981, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
Viruses also have some of the greatest future pandemic potential due to their ubiquity and fast-mutating nature.\\

Fortunately, global public health efforts have made increasingly effective strides toward understanding and eliminating viral pathogens, perhaps most famously by eradicating smallpox through a global vaccination campaign ending in the 1980.
A crucial step in the fight against viral pathogens has been the development of clinical and statistical methodologies that link the outcomes of viral epidemics (case counts, mortality rates, etc.) to the underlying determinants of pathogen spread that drive the epidemic---a field of study known as \textbf{epidemiology}.
While traditional epidemiology has provided invaluable insights, the advent of molecular techniques and the ever decreasing cost of full-genome sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of viral dynamics.
This dissertation explores the application of Bayesian phylogenetic methods to genomic epidemiological data, with a particular focus on \gls{sarscov2} and hepatitis B virus, demonstrating the broad applicability of these techniques in understanding and combating viral epidemics across several different clinically-important time scales.\\

\section{Viral epidemics}\label{sec:int-viralEpi}
Viral epidemics have shaped human history for millennia, leaving their mark on societies and civilizations throughout the ages.
These microscopic pathogens demonstrate an unparalleled ability to spread rapidly through populations, causing widespread illness, death, and social disruption.
From ancient times to the modern era, viruses have been silent yet powerful actors in the drama of human existence, influencing demographics, economies, and even the outcomes of wars.\\

The historical record is filled with examples of devastation caused by viral epidemics.
In the \nth{5} century BCE, the Plague of Athens decimated the population the eponymous city-state, altering the course of the Peloponnesian War \citep{thucydides}.
Modern-day analysis suggests that this plague may have been caused by a viral hemorrhagic fever \citep{olson1996thucydides}.
The globalization of human movement over the ensuing centuries facilitated the spread of viral pathogens across continents, leading to the emergence of pandemics that reshaped the course of human history.
The arrival of smallpox in the Americas in the \nth{16} century had catastrophic consequences for indigenous populations, facilitating European colonization and reshaping the New World's demographic landscape.
More recently still, the 1918 influenza pandemic, which claimed an estimated 50 million lives worldwide, stands as a stark reminder of the potential for viral pathogens to cause global calamity.\\

Up to the present, viral epidemics continue to pose significant challenges to global public health and socioeconomic stability.
The \gls{hiv}/AIDS pandemic, first recognized in the early 1980s, has claimed millions of lives and continues to affect communities worldwide.
The emergence of novel coronaviruses, including SARS in 2003 and \gls{sarscov2} in 2019, has demonstrated the ongoing threat of emerging viruses and their potential to rapidly spread in our interconnected world.
As humans continue to expand our built environment into previously uninhabited regions of the planet, we increase the likelihood of zoonotic (animal derived) spillover events, with pathogens such as avian influenza viruses, animal coronaviruses, or poxviruses currently posed as potential threats to future human health if we do not make efforts to hinder their potential jumps into the human population.
These events underscore the critical importance of understanding viral pathogens, their mechanisms of transmission, and their evolution to effectively combat future epidemics and minimize their impact on human society.\\

\subsection{Epidemics and pandemics}\label{sec:epidemicsVsPandemics}
The ensuing chapters of this dissertation will explore the evolutionary dynamics of viral pathogens across different spatiotemporal scales.
Before delving into the specifics of these analyses, it is helpful to define the terms ``epidemic'' and ``pandemic,'' and to outline the key distinctions between these two related concepts.\\

An \textbf{epidemic} refers to the occurrence of a disease that exhibits a frequency clearly in excess of normal expectancy within a specific community, geographical area, or season.
Epidemics are characterized by the rapid spread of disease across a particular population or region.
The threshold for declaring an epidemic is context-dependent, taking into account factors such as the pathogen's baseline prevalence, population susceptibility, and local health infrastructure.
Epidemics can vary in scale and duration, ranging from localized outbreaks affecting a single community to more widespread occurrences that impact multiple regions within a country or neighboring nations.\\

In contrast, a \textbf{pandemic} represents a more extensive and severe form of epidemic, typically characterized by the global spread of a novel pathogen or a new strain of an existing pathogen to which the human population has little to no pre-existing immunity.
Pandemics transcend international boundaries, often affecting multiple continents simultaneously and causing sustained community-level outbreaks.
The declaration of a pandemic by health authorities, such as the World Health Organization, considers not only the geographical extent of disease spread but also the severity of the illness and its societal impact.
Pandemics often result in significant morbidity and mortality on a global scale, strain healthcare systems worldwide, and can lead to severe socioeconomic disruptions across affected regions.\\

In this dissertation, I focus on the evolutionary dynamics of \gls{sarscov2} and hepatitis B virus, two viral pathogens that have had a profound impact on human health and society, however the analyses presented herein consider such dynamics in \textit{specific contexts}.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by \gls{sarscov2}, was declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 \citep{who_pandemic}, however the analyses described in Chapter~\ref{ch:chapter1} and Chapter~\ref{ch:chapter2} explore the phylodynamics of only the early COVID-19 epidemic in Belgium, and the Omicron epidemic in Pakistan, respectively.
The results of these analyses therefore cannot be extrapolated to the global dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic as a whole.
Chapter~\ref{ch:chapter3} explores the evolutionary history of hepatitis B virus, which is not considered to be an epidemic or pandemic in the traditional, but is rather endemic to the human population in most of the world.\\

\subsection{Traditional and genomic epidemiology}\label{sec:tradVsGenEpi}
The field of epidemiology has long been concerned with understanding the spread of infectious diseases and the factors that influence their transmission.
Traditional epidemiological methods, such as contact tracing, case reporting, and mathematical modeling, have been instrumental in controlling outbreaks and informing public health interventions for hundreds---if not thousands---of years.
One of the earliest examples of epidemiological investigation dates back to a 1854 cholera outbreak in the West End of London, where Dr. John Snow correlated counts of cholera cases at different addresses to nearby water sources.
By making such a correlation, he was able to identify a contaminated water pump on Broad Street as the putative source of the epidemic (Fig.~\ref{fig:broadStreetPump}).\\

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \label{fig:broadStreetPump}
\end{figure}

In the years since Snow's pioneering work, epidemiology has evolved into a multidisciplinary field that combines elements of medicine, public health, statistics, and social science to study and determinants of health and disease in populations.
Epidemiological methods have been instrumental in controlling infectious diseases, identifying risk factors for disease transmission, and evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions.
Indeed, as technology and data collection methods have advanced, epidemiologists have been able to develop increasingly sophisticated models of how diseases spread.\\

At the core of most epidemiological models lie three main data components: identified infections, locations, and times.
These three basic components can be combined in a number of ways to build more complex descriptions of disease spread (e.g. epidemic curves, spatial maps of disease incidence, etc.).
Both on their own and cobined with other sources (patient demography, clinical interventions and outcomes, etc.), these data can be input into extremely robust models that can be used to not only retrospectively describe epidemics, but also to make predictions about future spread that can be used to inform public health policy.\\

However, following the discovery of the structure of DNA by Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, and Francis Crick in 1953 \citep{franklin1953molecular,watson1953molecular}, the field of epidemiology has been revolutionized by the advent of molecular techniques.
The addition of molecular data gave epidemiologists a newfound ability to not just analyze the disease outcomes that are can be observed in a population, but also to analyze the biological agents directly responsible for the epidemics.
The field was further revolutionized in 1976, with the first full-genome sequence of a virus \citep{fiers1976complete}.
As sequencing technology has become more advanced and less expensive, we now have the ability to obtain full-genome sequences of viral pathogens from hundreds or thousands of infected individuals in a single outbreak, allowing us to compare the genetic sequences (Fig.~\ref{fig:alignment}) of the viruses and infer their evolutionary relationships.
We refer to these inferred hypotheses of shared evolutionary history as \textbf{phylogenies}, and the field of research related to their inference as \textbf{phylogenetics}.\\

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{alignment}
  \caption[Multiple sequence alignment]{An alignment of five example genomic sequences, aligned using MAFFT \bip{cite} and visualized using AliView \bip{cite}; each row represents a single sequence, and each column represents a site shared between sequences. Sites are colored by the amino acid present in each sequence at each site. The sequence \textit{Example2} represents the most common type of mutation that we observe: single nucleotide polymorphisms (\gls{snp}s), where a single sequence has a single mutation from one amino acid to another. Examples 3--5 represent other types of genomic motifs that are frequenty observed, but not always explicitly modeled by phylogenetic inference algorithms.}
  \label{fig:alignment}
\end{figure}

While it is interesting---and frequently useful---to understand the evolutionary relationships between viral sequences, the inferences made through phylogenetic analysis can tell us much more when we contextualize them in \textit{time} and \textit{space}.
Viruses (and in particuar \gls{rna} viruses) accumulate genomic mutations at a staggering rate compared to many other domains of biological entities (Fig.~\ref{fig:sizeVsRates}).
Because of this, we are frequently able to make observations (i.e. collect sequences) of viruses over the same time scales that epidemics play out, and make phylogenetic inferences on the same time scales.
We refer to this merger of phylogenetic and epidemic time scales as \textbf{phylodynamics}.
When viral genomes also come with associate geographic metadata, we are able to make further inferences (either in sequence or jointly with the phylogeny) of where common ancestors of taxa likely existed, and the associated rates of migration between the sampled locations.
This process of combined spatiotemporal and evolutionary inference will be referred from here on as \textbf{phylogeography}.\\

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{genSizeVsMutRate}
  \caption[Genome size vs. mutation rate in viruses.]{It is a well known phenomenon that as genome size and complexity increases, observed mutation (and evolutionary) rates decrease. For viruses in particular, this has the practical upshot that it means that genomic mutations accumulate frequently enough that they can be found during epidemic timescales.

\subsection{A general model of the epidemic process}
In the pursuit of descriptive models for pathogen evolution and spread, it is important to ask, ``Is this model a faithful description of my biological question?''
To answer this question, it is necessary to construct a high-level framework of this biological system (i.e. epidemic spread), and to recognize the assumptions inherent to that framework.
To this end, a brief description of the epidemic process as seen through the lens of phylogenetics is required so that we can answer the question, ``Do molecular phylogenies accurately describe viral epidemics?''\\

At the beginning of an epidemic, we imagine that there is a single individual who may be infected by a virus, and they remain infectious for some limited period of time (either they will recover to the point of no longer being infectious, or die).
During thier infectious period, the individual may go on to infect one or more other individuals with the virus.
This process is then able to repeat itself for each of the infected individuals, and in turn for individuals infected downstream.
Generally, if on average each infected person spreads the virus to more than one new person the epidemic will grow, and if they spread to fewer than one person on average then the epidemic will shrink.
At some point---or in practice at many points---during the downstream epidemic, individuals may be sampled and a complete viral genomic sequence may be isolated from the individual.


\bip{Assumptions: complete enough bottleneck, mutations happen along branches, each infection can be described by a consensus genome, infections are instantaneous and each happen at a different time.}

% Infectious diseases are now emerging or reemerging almost every year.
% This trend will continue because a number of factors, including increased global population, aging, travel, urbanization, and climate change, favor the emergence, evolution, and spread of new pathogens \citep{bloom2017emerging}.
% Many of these pathogens represent a clear and eminent threat to public health, as the ongoing corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made brutally clear, as well as a tremendous burden on global economies.
% Other examples from the last few years include the emergence of West Nile \citep{hadfield2019twenty}, H5N1 \citep{imai2018diversity}, H1N1 \citep{bedford2015global}, Ebola \citep{dudas2017virus}, Zika \citep{fauci2016zika, faria2016zika} and Lassa \citep{kafetzopoulou2019metagenomic}.
% Demographic forces amplify the risks associated with such emerging infectious diseases (\gls{eid}).
% The global population is expected to grow to 8 billion in the near future, with nearly 60\% of the population living in relatively crowded urban areas.
% Among \gls{eid}, viral pathogens, particularly RNA viruses, stand as major concerns, owing to their high rates of nucleotide substitution and capacity to adapt to new hosts.
% Viral sequence data are invaluable for characterizing these pathogens.
% Analyzing the historical information contained in viral genomes contributes to better insight into viral emergence and early transmission dynamics, even before systematic epidemiological surveillance initiates.

% \section{Phylogenetics}

% Molecular phylogenetic inference is a particularly powerful tool available to scientists interested in inferring pathogen dynamics.
% This is a methodology by which the shared evolutionary history of a set of genomic sequences, sometimes referred to as taxa, is hypothesized based on genomic similarity.
% Phylogenetic methodologies come in many different forms, ranging from simple heuristics that approximate phylogenetic relationships based on the number of observed differences between sequences \citep{felsenstein2003inferring} to highly complex models that use demographic and geographic population structure as well as state-of-the-art models of evolution to inform phylogenetic inference \citep{dudas2018mers}.
% Additionally, phylogenetic analyses may be combined with other methodologies (e.g. methods in population genetics \citep{felsenstein2003inferring} or epidemiology \citep{black2020ten}) to provide insight into the relationship between evolutionary dynamics and other processes.
% Such processes include the dynamics of population size through time or number of migration events between geographic locations during an organism's evolutionary history.

% Phylogenetic methods can help reveal many features of a set of related taxa.
% The most frequent use of these methods is to construct a phylogenetic tree: a bifurcating (or sometimes multifurcating) representation of the inferred evolutionary history of a set of contemporary taxa---represented as tips or leaves of the tree---with inferred shared ancestors represented by internal nodes where two or more branches of the tree meet, eventually coalescing at the most recent common ancestor (\gls{mrca}) of all the taxa in a dataset.
% Such trees often use length of branches to represent genetic distance between nodes.
% A more useful representation of evolutionary history can be found by rescaling branch lengths along a tree according to a mutation rate which provides a mapping between genetic distance and time, allowing the phylogeny to be represented as a function of time.
% Phylogenetic trees can also be used to infer the shared mutation history of a set of sequences, thereby allowing the reconstruction of inferred ancestral genomes.
% Similar methods may be used to reconstruct the ancestral states of various discrete or continuous traits associated with the taxa of the tree.
% Common examples of these types of analyses include analyses of particular phenotypes of interest and phylogeographic analyses that treat sequence sampling locations as traits and aim to reconstruct the spatiotemporal spread of pathogens.
% Finally, phylogenetic methods often hypothesize a link between population dynamics and tree shape---formalized through coalescent theory \citep{Kingman1982}---whereby small populations are expected to have relatively high rates of branching (and therefore relatively short branch lengths) compared to larger populations.
% Visual examples of all of these aspects of phylodynamic analyses are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:phylogeneticsOverview} \citep{pybus2009evolutionary}.



% One particularly useful application of phylogenetics is in the analysis of viral pathogen outbreaks.
% Viruses represent unique study systems for both the theoretical development of phylogenetic methodologies and the implementation of phylogenetic analyses in settings with tangible public health impact.
% In addition to their ubiquity and high profile within the human population, viruses prove highly suitable for phylogenetic inference because of their fast evolutionary rates, relatively small genomes, and frequent adherence to the assumptions of a single evolutionary history.
% Phylogenetic methods have often been used to perform \textit{post hoc} analyses of viral outbreaks, however significant work is still required before such methods can be used to inform public health responses in ``real-time'' during an ongoing epidemic.
% In this thesis, we describe phylogenetic analyses of two viral pathogens---hepatitis B virus (\gls{hbv}) and Lassa virus (\gls{lasv}).
% We use these analyses to illustrate the use of current phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis in performing retrospective analysis, and to provide a framework for novel ``online'' phylogenetic analyses that can be performed in real-time during a viral epidemic.

% \section{Measurably evolving populations and temporal signal}

% While performing phylogenetic analyses, we are often interested in how populations evolve as a function of time, rather than as a function of genetic distance.
% To this end, we seek to correlate differences in our input data (i.e. genetic distance) with time.
% We do this by assuming that mutations accumulate along the branches of a phylogenetic tree according to some rate, which can be posited to hold a constant value across the entire phylogeny \citep{brown2011rate}, or can vary by branch according to different statistical models known as ``clock models'' \citep{drummond2006relaxed, drummond2010randomLocal}.
% We refer to this rate as an ``evolutionary rate'', generally represented in units of substitutions per site per year, which can be used to rescale the branches of a phylogeny from units of genetic distance to units of time.

% Historically, calibration of the clock models describing the evolutionary rates across branch were informed by estimates of divergence times between known lineages using fossil calibration \citep{pauling1963chemical, zuckerkandl1965molecules, near2005turtles}---a process whereby internal node times were set to an externally-supplied date of divergence.
% While this approach works well for reconstructing phylogenies for eukaryotic species whose extant genomes are more-or-less isochronous and fossil records exist to date ancient divergences, it has limited use in the inference of molecular clocks in viruses, where known divergence times may be much more limited.
% Indeed, it is frequently impossible to provide accurate prior estimates of historical divergence times, and we instead wish to infer molecular evolutionary rates directly from heterochronous (i.e. sampled a period of time) sequences.
% We call the existence of sufficient statistical power from heterochronous sequence data to determine an evolutionary rate ``temporal signal'', and we refer to a population from which we can observe a statistically significant number of mutations through time a ``measurably evolving population'' (\gls{mep}) \citep{drummond2003measurably}.
% In general, there are two sources from which we can observe \gls{mep}s: populations with available ancient genomes and rapidly evolving RNA viruses.
% Analysis of data sets that contain ancient genomes has proven to be an effective way of inferring the phylodynamics of eukaryotic populations \citep{shapiro2004bison}. %GB: if there is still room, I would be tempted to provide more information regarding this example, and perhaps the key figure from that paper
% %BP: I've not been able to think of a good way of adding this as an example without spending an inordinate amount of space. I'll add this as a backup slide in the presentation in case a question comes up.

% \section{Bayesian phylodynamic inference}

% In this thesis, I specifically aim to use Bayesian methodologies of phylogenetic inference.
% Unlike many other approaches, including fast maximum-likelihood methods, Bayesian inference does not assume that the parameters which govern statistical models take a single-point value, but rather come from a posterior probability distribution.
% Such methodologies are also informed by hypotheses of these parameter distributions provided \textit{a priori} by researchers---referred to as parameter prior distributions.
% Bayesian methodologies are particularly well suited to phylogenetic methods in several key ways.
% Firstly, they allow researchers to create estimates of evolutionary histories that account for uncertainty in the phylogenies and in other model parameters, and for which statistical support can be calculated.
% Additionally, Bayesian phylogenetic methods afford researchers the opportunity to infer many different parameters of interest (e.g. mutation rates, effective population sizes, and migration rates) jointly with the phylogeny.
% Finally, algorithms for performing Bayesian phylogenetic inference have been implemented for many different evolutionary models as a part of open-source software packages (\gls{beast}, MrBayes \citep{huelsenbeck2001mrbayes}) allowing tractable computation of complex datasets. %BP: updated to address poorly worded previous version.

% To perform Bayesian (phylodynamic) inference it's frequently necessary to compute high-dimensional integrals to produce exact posterior distributions, a task that's unfortunately analytically intractable in nearly all but the simplest of situations.
% However, this hurdle can be overcome by simulating a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the desired posterior distribution.
% This approach is known as Markov chain Monte Carlo (\gls{mcmc}) and can be exploited to numerically approximate posterior distributions of phylogenetic models.

% The implementation of such methods typically works according to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \citep{metropolis1953equation, hastings1970monte}.
% First, a starting value for each parameter of interest---including the initial tree topology---is randomly drawn from its prior distribution or set to pre-specified values
% We call this parameter set $\mathbf{\theta}$.
% A new ``proposal'' set, $\mathbf{\theta^\prime}$, is then generated by stochastically perturbing the original parameter set according to various parameter-specific transition kernels with probability $g(\mathbf{\theta^\prime}\vert\mathbf{\theta})$.
% A likelihood for the model can then be calculated for both the initial parameter set, $L(\mathbf{\theta})$, and the proposal set, $L(\mathbf{\theta^{\prime}})$.
% The ratio of each likelihood to its associated parameter probabilities is used to define an acceptance probability, $A$, for that parameter set such that the acceptance ratio of the initial set is $A(\mathbf{\theta}, \mathbf{\theta^{\prime}})=\frac{L(\mathbf{\theta})}{g(\mathbf{\theta}\vert\mathbf{\theta^\prime})}$ and the acceptance ratio for the proposal set is $A(\mathbf{\theta^\prime}, \mathbf{\theta})=\frac{L(\mathbf{\theta^\prime})}{g(\mathbf{\theta^\prime}\vert\mathbf{\theta})}$.
% The new proposal set is accepted with probability proportional to the ratio of these acceptance probabilities:
% $$
% \frac{A(\mathbf{\theta}, \mathbf{\theta^{\prime}})}{A(\mathbf{\theta^\prime}, \mathbf{\theta})} = min(1,\frac{L(\mathbf{\theta^\prime})}{L(\mathbf{\theta})}\frac{g(\mathbf{\theta}\vert\mathbf{\theta^\prime})}{g(\mathbf{\theta^\prime}\vert\mathbf{\theta})}).
% $$
% That is, if the proposal set yields a higher acceptance probability than the initial set, it is accepted as the new parameter set, and if it has an acceptance probability lower than the initial candidate set, it will be accepted with probability proportional to the ratio of the two acceptance probabilities.
% This process is then repeated until a stable parameter set is reached.
% This stable set is considered to be the posterior distribution from which we would like to sample.
% Once this stable set is found, the same process is continued, with the state of the chain recorded at regular intervals, until the posterior has been sufficiently explored.
% At that stage, which can take days or even weeks to reach (but see section~\ref{sec:ess}), we can stop our Bayesian analysis and construct summaries of all parameters of interest.

% \subsection{Statistical and computational challenges}

% One of the major challenges of phylogenetic inference that can lead to very time-consuming analyses is the vast size of the state space of potentially inferred variables.
% The size of ``tree space''---the set of all possible phylogenetic trees for a given dataset---scales at the rate $\frac{(2n-3)!}{2^{n-1}(n-1)!}$.
% This is far too large to exhaustively explore for the datasets that researchers are typically interested in; for a dataset consisting of only thirty taxa, the number of possible rooted, labeled phylogenies totals over $10^{38}$ \citep{felsenstein2003inferring}.
% For the datasets that we explore in this thesis---ranging in size to 769 taxa---this number grows to vastly overshadow the number of atoms in the observable universe.
% As such, exhaustively exploring this space is impossible, and traversing this space algorithmically can still take considerable time.

% \subsection{Effective sample size and burn-in}
% \label{sec:ess}

% Bayesian phylogenetic inference of large, complex datasets can hence take upwards of a month of constant computational time before a chain achieves convergence and has adequately explored the full posterior distribution.
% During this time, the constructed Markov chain is sampled at fixed intervals by recording the state of all parameters of the chain.
% How thoroughly the posterior has been sampled can be quantified using a metric known as the effective sample size (\gls{ess})---a measure of the number of effectively independent draws from the posterior distribution that the Markov chain sample is equivalent to.
% Because sequential samples of the chain's state are frequently highly correlated, the \gls{ess} is an appropriate metric for how fully the \gls{mcmc} has explored the posterior distribution of interest.
% While there is no theoretical foundation for using a specific cut-off value when computing the \gls{ess}, a commonly applied consensus is to accumulate \gls{ess} values over 200 for each parameter of interest as a decent trade-off between length of computation and the number of independent samples collected for a specific parameter.

% A significant amount of computation time is consumed by the chain moving from its starting point in state space toward the posterior distribution---a period referred to as the ``burn-in''.
% Because the chain aims to rapidly traverse parameter space towards the posterior, this initial burn-in phase does not help to accumulate independent samples from said posterior and hence the entire burn-in period is discarded prior to summarizing the results from the analysis.
% A major computational issue stemming from the burn-in period is that the time spent in burn-in can only be mitigated by either specifying prior distributions that are strongly informative of the posterior distribution, or by designing novel transition kernels to move towards the posterior in a more efficient manner.
% This means that even if identically parameterized chains are run in parallel the burn-in period must take place for each independent run, significantly lowering the utility of chain-level parallelization.

% \subsection{BEAST}

% For the analyses described in this thesis, I make use of the software package Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (\gls{beast}) 1.10 \citep{suchard2018bayesian}.
% \gls{beast} is an easy-to-use software package in which many Bayesian phylogenetic models---and their associated priors and transition kernels---have been implemented and optimized such that analyses on large datasets may be easily specified and run efficiently on a wide variety of computing resources.
% This tool mostly implements Bayesian phylogenetic inference via \gls{mcmc}.
% Recent developments have started exploring the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approaches to speed computation times and ensure more thorough exploration of state space.
% Analyses in \gls{beast} are facilitated by hardware optimization libraries such as BEAGLE \citep{ayres2019beagle}, as well as a large suite of utility programs that make running analyses in parallel and quickly interpreting results feasible.

% \section{Viral pathogens}
% Viral pathogen outbreaks are a particularly useful study system for Bayesian phylogeneticists because their relatively small genomes typically allow for tractable computation.
% The rapidity with which viruses move though populations and their fast evolutionary rates give many viral pathogens rather strong temporal signal, and therefore make them good candidates for Bayesian phylogenetic inference.
% Viral pathogens make interesting study systems because of the large influence that they exert on human quality of life.
% Viruses frequently cause human suffering and death, both as endemic diseases (seasonal influenza, hepatitis, etc.) and the agents behind sudden disease epidemics (Zika, Ebola, Lassa).
% Indeed, viruses have been responsible for the majority of the most deadly pandemics of the last century (1918 Spanish influenza, 2009 Swine flu, COVID-19).
% Even when they do not cause large-scale epidemics or global pandemics, or when they do not cause death, viruses can still cause vast amounts of human suffering though localized, small-scale outbreaks that cause severe health problems for those that they infect.
% In this thesis, we present the results of Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of two separate viral pathogens: hepatitis B virus (\gls{hbv}) and Lassa virus (\gls{lasv}).
% Here, we provide some information regarding the genome structure of these two pathogens, which will aid in justifying modeling assumptions in subsequent chapters.


% \subsection{Hepatitis B virus (HBV)}

% \gls{hbv} has infected over two billion people worldwide and puts over 350 million people at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer \citep{kane1995global}.
% The virus is classified into eight different genotypes based on genomic sequence divergence.
% These genotypes show strong ethnospatial patterns and are often correlated directly to the region of the world where they are most prominent \citep{schaefer2007hepatitis}.
% \gls{hbv} consists of two partially overlapping strands of DNA (Fig.~\ref{fig:hbvGenome}).
% The long strand ranges from 3,020--3,320 bases in length, while the short strand ranges from 1,700--2,800 nucleotides long, depending on genotype \citep{kay2007hepatitis}.
